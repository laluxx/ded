#+title: Todo

* TODO
every function defined in the code should be callable
while the app is running emacs style M-x []

** Modeline
show the current EvilMode, file name, info and cool icons
** Minibuffer
to get user input for anything and everything popups are for loosers
** Minimap
code minimap from scratch
** cursor
adjust syze based on overed glyph [x]
** Font
changing font more times than the total number of font you have inside =~/.config/ded/fonts=
make the text disappear []
** Camera
 when animation are false move the camera like in emacs or vim [x]
 togglable emacs style camera centering []
** Shaders
use shaders from =~/.config/ded/shaders= instead [x]
** Lexer
chech for strings in arrays []
multi line comments []
different vertex and fragment shader per token []
different font per token []
'' [x]
NULL [x]
syntax highlighting for : | || & && [x]
highlight links [x]
** Renderer 
render_trailing_whitespaces []
line under links []
render circles (we need to use a shader for better performance) [/]
** Addresses
 showIndentationLines = 5555555792d2 i8
 currentThemeIndex    = 555559015340

** Theme
each theme should have a name not only and index

** Evil
evil-find-char-backward []
evil-visual-liene-mode []
evil-search-backward []
splits(maybe)   []
5k should work []

shift + i [x]
evil-change-line(smarter version, don't delete ";") [x]
evil-delete-backward-char [x]
evil-search-word-forward (shift + 8) [x]
shift + 5 [x]
** Bugs
opening a file with ded file.c that contain a
function definition, trow a [1] 35755 segmentation fault (core dumped)

activate_snippet on "if" take two times to activate
also editor_backspace take 3 times to delete []

** Editor
in M-x if the input is a number go to that line in the editor if it exist
dim a split the smaller it is []

option to render whitespaces on selection []

theme creator gui where colors update in real time []

function to search code in a specific C case 

map all variables to a string  and write the gui  to inspect variables st runtime and change them []

replace on typing when selection is true []
move entire curly brace block of code on space as an option []

if the search found nothing until the end of the file wrap arround
and check from the start of the fil until the cursor []


switch true to false or false to true in editor_enter []

measure_whitespace_width only once on font switch rather
than 4 times every frame []

find_first_non_whitespace(and refactor) [/]
select_function []
org mode []
md mode rendered as you type []
refactor on write(save) []
smarter editor_enter and editor_backspace []

u can only type stuff that exist in the file in the
search buffer, u should be able to type anything
(also highlight not found stuff in red like emacs) []

goto definition (a dumb version later i will integrate lsp)[]
Togglable emacs like scroll for when animations are disabled []
ivy for everything []
imenu for function definition jump []
sub-pixel antialiasing []
multicursor[]
Iedit[]
Fringe(showing unsaved changes, and later with git integration )[]
Replace mode []
Replace character mode []
Pipe selection to unix command []
Togglable visibility of new lines[]
Togglable indentation lines[]
show character under cursor with the same color as the bg[]
search should not be case sensitive []
support multiple marks not just one []
render wavy or normal line under text for errors or whatever []
most symple emacs style completition (ctrl + n in insert mode)[]
use window hight and width dinamicly instead of fixed position when animations are off []





a theme should be able to define how much lighter of the bg
whitespaces indicators are in % (currently hardcoded to 70%)[x]
keep a list of opened files to quickly
go to the previous or next "buffer" or kill them [x]
mismatched cut and selection [x]
Drag lines up/down [x] // TODO drag selection or multiple cursors BUG behaves bad when there are only 2 lines in the editor and you swap them
Editor_new_line_down and up should mantain indentation [x]
yasnippet [x] TODO
when copying with y do it like vim[x] TODO BUG
evil join on shift + j [x]
Emacs mode [x]
Togglable visibility of whitespaces[x]
different cursor color based on the mode[x]
if editor->has_mark make the cursor trasparent [x]
ctrl + backspace should delete an entire word [x]
